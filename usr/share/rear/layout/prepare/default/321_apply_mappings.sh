#   BTRFS_SUBVOLUME_SLES_SETUP=( /dev/sda2 )
# that is now changed (e.g. because of a mapping from /dev/sda to /dev/sdb) to
#   BTRFS_SUBVOLUME_SLES_SETUP=( /dev/sdb2 )
# but /etc/rear/rescue.conf was already read by /etc/scripts/system-setup
# so that this changed variable must now be read again from /etc/rear/rescue.conf
# but we do not source the whole /etc/rear/rescue.conf again to be on the safe side
# perhaps some is not idempotent like "array+=( new elements )"
# or other variables in /etc/rear/rescue.conf may have been changed
# so we only re-read the BTRFS_SUBVOLUME_SLES_SETUP variable:
